A little info

# 👋🏽 Hey there, I’m Kevin

### 🌍 Ghanaian student with a love for code, calisthenics, and creativity.

I’m currently diving deep into Java & C++, building not just programs—but **entire worlds**. Whether it’s designing smarter systems or writing cleaner code, I’m here to learn, build, and level up.

## 🛠️ Projects In Progress
- 🚧 **Smart Expense Tracker (Java API)** – managing money smartly, one line at a time.
- 🧾 **Inventory Manager (C++ Terminal App)** – keeping track, even in the terminal trenches.
